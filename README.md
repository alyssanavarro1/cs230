1)Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
The Gaming Room was a client and they wanted to have a web based game to serve multiple platforms. They wanted to expand the audience of their game, Draw it or Lose it, since it was only available to Android users.

2)What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did pretty well in writing out the process of going about this project and making sure that I was thorough in my explanation. There were never any comments or points taken off for my writing so I think that was my strongest point.

3)What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think it helps bring a layout for what to approach when writing code. The design documents allows me to see everything that needs to be accomplished through the code. It serves as like a map that I can follow to get my end goal.

4)If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably revise the part with the UML diagram because I feel like that was the weakest section of my work. To improve it I would make another UML diagram and maybe express what each step meant more.

5)How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the user's needs because like in the name they are the user. They are the ones that are going to be using the app the most and it is important to be sure everything runs smoothly for them. There should be options for what the user might want to do which helps ensure everyone is accounted for.

6)How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think breaking things down piece by piece really helped me. By this I mean I liked how each week would add more content to the document and it wasn't everything all at one. I think that was really helpful for me.
